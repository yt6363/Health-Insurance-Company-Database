--To enhance targeted marketing capabilities through detailed patient information analysis, you can leverage SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from your data. Here are a few examples of how to analyze the patient data to support targeted marketing:


--1. Identify Patients Based on Age Groups
--If you want to target patients within a specific age range (e.g., 30-40 years old):

SELECT 
    patient_id, 
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    date_of_birth, 
    insurance_id,
    YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(date_of_birth) AS age
FROM 
    Patients
WHERE 
    YEAR(CURDATE()) - YEAR(date_of_birth) BETWEEN 30 AND 40;



--This query identifies patients aged between 30 and 40, which can help target this demographic with specific health plans or services.

--2. Find Patients with Premium Insurance Plans
--If you want to identify patients with premium insurance plans for targeted marketing of high-end services:

SELECT 
    p.patient_id, 
    p.first_name, 
    p.last_name, 
    i.insurance_provider, 
    i.policy_type
FROM 
    Patients p
JOIN 
    Insurance i ON p.insurance_id = i.insurance_id
WHERE 
    i.policy_type = 'Premium';


--This query lists patients who have 'Premium' insurance policies.


--3. Locate Patients by Region for Location-Based Marketing
--If you want to market to patients based on their location:



SELECT 
    patient_id, 
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    address 
FROM 
    Patients
WHERE 
    address LIKE '%New York%';

--This query finds patients residing in New York, enabling location-based marketing.
--4. Identify Patients with Specific Medical Needs
--If you have specific medical services or specializations and want to target patients:

SELECT 
    p.patient_id, 
    p.first_name, 
    p.last_name, 
    ph.specialty 
FROM 
    Patients p
JOIN 
    Patient_Physician pp ON p.patient_id = pp.patient_id
JOIN 
    Physicians ph ON pp.physician_id = ph.physician_id
WHERE 
    ph.specialty = 'Cardiology';

--This query lists patients who are seeing a cardiologist, which is helpful for targeting those patients with heart health-related services.
--5. Group Patients by Insurance Provider for Bulk Marketing Campaigns
--If you want to create marketing campaigns targeted at specific insurance providers:

SELECT 
    i.insurance_provider, 
    COUNT(p.patient_id) AS number_of_patients
FROM 
    Patients p
JOIN 
    Insurance i ON p.insurance_id = i.insurance_id
GROUP BY 
    i.insurance_provider
ORDER BY 
    number_of_patients DESC;
    
--This query counts the number of patients by insurance provider, giving insight into which insurers have the most patients, which can be useful for creating targeted campaigns.

--6. Patients with Upcoming Birthdays for Special Promotions
--If you want to target patients with upcoming birthdays for promotional offers:

SELECT 
    patient_id, 
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    DATE_FORMAT(date_of_birth, '%m-%d') AS birthday 
FROM 
    Patients
WHERE 
    DATE_FORMAT(date_of_birth, '%m-%d') BETWEEN DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%m-%d') AND DATE_FORMAT(DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY), '%m-%d');


--This query finds patients who have birthdays within the next 30 days, useful for sending special birthday promotions.
